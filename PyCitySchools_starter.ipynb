    "Conclusion #1 - While charter schools are smaller in population than the district schools, thier budgets are smaller in terms of dollar to dollar amount, however, the per student budget comparision shows that there is only about a $45 difference on average between the two types of schools. \n",
    "Conclusion #2 - The charters schools have higher academic scores than the district schools. This aligns with the concept that smaller class sizes attribute to higher test scores among students. "
